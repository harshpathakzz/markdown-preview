## Description

The Markdown Preview and Download Tool is a React-based web application that provides users with a convenient way to compose, preview, and download Markdown content. Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used for formatting text that can be converted to HTML or other document formats. This project leverages React along with the `react-markdown` library to offer real-time Markdown preview capabilities. Additionally, users can easily download their Markdown creations as files for offline use or sharing.

## Key Features

- **Live Markdown Preview:** As users type or modify Markdown content in the provided textarea, the adjacent section automatically generates a live preview of the formatted output. This feature helps users visualize the final appearance of their Markdown content.

- **ReactMarkdown Integration:** The project integrates the `react-markdown` library to seamlessly convert and render Markdown syntax into HTML content. This allows users to see how their Markdown will be rendered in a user-friendly and properly formatted manner.

- **Download Option:** A prominent "Download" button, styled using the Material-UI framework (`@mui`), is available for users. Clicking this button triggers the creation of a downloadable Markdown file containing the current content. The downloaded file is named "README.md" and can be saved to the user's local file system.

- **Blob Creation:** The project uses the Blob constructor to create a Blob object representing the Markdown content. Blobs are binary large objects that represent data, in this case, Markdown content, with the appropriate MIME type.

- **Object URL:** The URL of the Blob object is obtained using `URL.createObjectURL()`. This URL is associated with a dynamically created `<a>` element, allowing users to download the Markdown content as a file with a single click.

- **Dynamic User Interaction:** State management is facilitated using React's `useState` hook. When the user modifies the Markdown input, the state is updated, triggering a re-render of the live preview section.

- **Modular Components:** The project is structured into modular components, including the App component and the Button component from the Material-UI library. This organization enhances code readability, maintainability, and reusability.
